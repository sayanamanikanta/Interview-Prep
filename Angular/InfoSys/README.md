1. ### What is router
    Routing in Angular helps us navigate from one view to another as users perform tasks in web apps.

    To handle the navigation from one view to the next, you use the Angular Router. The Router enables navigation by interpreting a browser URL as an instruction to change the view

    * **Creating routes**
    ```ts
    const routes: Routes = [
        { path: 'about', component: AboutComponent },
    ];
    ```
    * **Accessing routes**
        * Include router-outlet tag in the root component template
        ```ts
        <router-outlet></router-outlet>
        ```
        * Use routerLink and routerLinkActive property in the required place
        ```ts
        <a routerLink="/about" routerLinkActive="active">First Component</a>
        ```

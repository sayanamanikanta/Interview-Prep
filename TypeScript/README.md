1. ### What is TypeScript
    TypeScript is an open-source language developed by Anders Hejlsberg at Microsoft. It’s a statically-typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. It runs on any browser, host, and operating system. That means all valid JavaScript code is also TypeScript code. It offers advanced features such as IntelliSense, code completion, safe refactorings, etc

1. ### Why TypeScript?
    As JavaScript projects grow in size, they become difficult to maintain. There are a few reasons for this. First, JavaScript was never designed to build large-scale applications. Its original purpose was to provide small scripting functionality for a web page. Until recently, it didn’t provide tools and constructs for structuring large projects, such as classes, modules, and interfaces. Also, JavaScript is dynamically typed. It doesn’t support features such as IntelliSense
